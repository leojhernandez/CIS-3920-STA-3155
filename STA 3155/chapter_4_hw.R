1. Produce a scatterplot between the Cost of Living Index and EACH of the other index variables. As a
result, there should be 4 scatterplots in total. Examine the relationship shown in each scatterplot in
terms of its form, strength and direction.

2. Compute the correlation coefficients for all the scatterplots obtained above.

3. Verify the conditions for EACH correlation coefficient computed above.

4. Fit a linear regression model between the Cost of Living Index and each of the other index variables.
As a result, there should be 4 regression models in total. Interpret the resulting estimated slope in each
model.

5. Based on the correlation coefficients and the regression models obtained above, which item would be
the best predictor of overall cost in these cities? Which would be the worst? Explain.

6. Find the cost of living as predicted by Groceries Index and its residual for Beijing, China. (Hint: Find
row index of Beijing in the dataset, and then use that index to extract the corresponding fitted value
and residual from the regression result.)
