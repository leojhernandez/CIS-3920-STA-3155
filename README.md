## Thanks for stopping by!
This repository is part of projects and statistical methodologies I've learned at Baruch College and other online courses. The goal of this is to explore basic statistics analysis using R. When it comes to statistical concepts, it's important to know when to apply these concepts when analyzing data. Topics such as linear regression, correlation, clustering, IQR, null vs. alternative hypothesis will be introduced in this repo.
